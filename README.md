# The Zen of Elixir

Mastering Elixir is *not easy*. This project tries to collect the most inspiring
resources about Elixir. It's not about teaching, it's about the most important
things that every Elixir programmer should know.

There're some articles telling you these, but there's no place to keep them for
Elixir beginners. It's why this project is created. *They are even very useful
even if you are not a Elixir programmer.*

(Check [awesome-elixir](https://github.com/h4cc/awesome-elixir#resources)
and [Elixir Radar](http://plataformatec.com.br/elixir-radar/) if you want to
find resources about it.)

## Erlang

* [The Zen of Erlang](http://ferd.ca/the-zen-of-erlang.html)

It's important to understand Erlang if you want to be a master of Elixir.
Try to think in Erlang's way by reading Fred's great article.

## Elixir

* [Beyond Functional Programming with Elixir and Erlang](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/05/beyond-functional-programming-with-elixir-and-erlang/)

As you know, Erlang/Elixir is a functional language. However, why is it designed
to be functional and how José thinks about functional language?

* [Comparing Elixir and Erlang variables](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2016/01/comparing-elixir-and-erlang-variables/)

It's a little confusing to understand rebinding for immutable variables in Elixir.
Let José explain this for you :)

* [Elixir in times of microservices](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/06/elixir-in-times-of-microservices/)

Elixir aims at scalability and maintainability, but how to achieve this?
You should consider **umbrella projects** first for your great projects.

* [Mocks and explicit contracts](http://blog.plataformatec.com.br/2015/10/mocks-and-explicit-contracts/)

Elixir is dynamic, so tests are important. It's functional, so it will be very
different to write tests. Forget what you know and learn from this great post.

## Phoenix

* [Phoenix Is Not Your Application](http://www.elixirconf.eu/elixirconf2016/lance-halvorsen)
and [the discussion on elixirforum](https://elixirforum.com/t/phoenix-is-not-your-application-questions/735)

Phoenix is just an [application](http://elixir-lang.org/docs/stable/elixir/Application.html)
like other applications. So learn to think of Phoenix in this way from this talk.
